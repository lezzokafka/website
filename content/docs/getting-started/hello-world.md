To kick off our tour of Tokio, we will start with the obligatory "hello world"
example. This program will create a TCP stream and write "hello, world!" to the stream.
The difference between this and a Rust program that writes to a TCP stream without Tokio
is that this program won't block program execution when the stream is created or when
our "hello, world!" message is written to the stream.

Before we begin you should have a very basic understanding of how TCP streams work. Having
an understanding of Rustâ€™s [standard library implementation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html)
is also helpful.

Let's get started.

First, generate a new crate.

```bash
$ cargo new hello-world
$ cd hello-world
```

Next, add the necessary dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = "0.1"
```

and the crates and types into scope in `main.rs`:

```rust
# #![deny(deprecated)]
extern crate tokio;

use tokio::io;
use tokio::net::TcpStream;
use tokio::prelude::*;
# fn main() {}
```

Here we use Tokio's own [`io`] and [`net`] modules. These modules provide the same
abstractions over networking and I/O-operations as the corresponding modules in `std`
with a small difference: all actions are performed asynchronously.

# Creating the stream

The first step is to create the `TcpStream`. We use the `TcpStream` implementation
provided by Tokio.

```rust
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# extern crate tokio;
#
# use tokio::net::TcpStream;
fn main() {
    // Parse the address of whatever server we're talking to
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:6142".parse().unwrap();
    let client = TcpStream::connect(&addr);

    // Following snippets come here...
}
```

Next, we'll add some to the `client` `TcpStream`. This asynchronous task now creates
the stream and then yields it once it's been created for additional processing.

```rust
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# extern crate tokio;
#
# use tokio::net::TcpStream;
# use tokio::prelude::*;
# fn main() {
# let addr = "127.0.0.1:6142".parse().unwrap();
let client = TcpStream::connect(&addr).and_then(|stream| {
    println!("created stream");

    // Process stream here.

    Ok(())
})
.map_err(|err| {
    // All tasks must have an `Error` type of `()`. This forces error
    // handling and helps avoid silencing failures.
    //
    // In our example, we are only going to log the error to STDOUT.
    println!("connection error = {:?}", err);
});
# }
```

The call to `TcpStream::connect` returns a [`Future`] of the created TCP stream.
We'll learn more about [`Futures`] later in the guide, but for now you can think of
a [`Future`] as a value that represents something that will eventually happen in the
future (in this case the stream will be created). This means that `TcpStream::connect` does
not wait for the stream to be created before it returns. Rather it returns immediately
with a value representing the work of creating a TCP stream. We'll see down below when this work
_actually_ gets executed.

The `and_then` method yields the stream once it has been created. `and_then` is an
example of a combinator function that defines how asynchronous work will be processed.

Each combinator function takes ownership of necessary state as well as the
callback to perform and returns a new `Future` that has the additional "step"
sequenced. A `Future` is a value representing some computation that will complete at
some point in the future.

It's worth reiterating that returned futures are lazy, i.e., no work is performed when
calling the combinator. Instead, once all the asynchronous steps are sequenced, the
final `Future` (representing the entire task) is 'spawned' (i.e., run). This is when
the previously defined work starts getting run. In other words, the code we've written
so far does not actually create a TCP stream.

We will be digging more into futures (and the related concepts of streams and sinks)
later on.

It's also important to note that we've called `map_err` to convert whatever error
we may have gotten to `()` before we can actually run our future. This ensures that
we acknowledge errors.

Next, we will process the stream.

# Writing data

Our goal is to write `"hello world\n"` to the stream.

Going back to the `TcpStream::connect(addr).and_then` block:

```rust
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# extern crate tokio;
#
# use tokio::io;
# use tokio::prelude::*;
# use tokio::net::TcpStream;
# fn main() {
# let addr = "127.0.0.1:6142".parse().unwrap();
let client = TcpStream::connect(&addr).and_then(|stream| {
    println!("created stream");

    io::write_all(stream, "hello world\n").then(|result| {
      println!("wrote to stream; success={:?}", result.is_ok());
      Ok(())
    })
})
# ;
# }
```

The [`io::write_all`] function takes ownership of `stream`, returning a
[`Future`] that completes once the entire message has been written to the
stream. `then` is used to sequence a step that gets run once the write has
completed. In our example, we just write a message to `STDOUT` indicating that
the write has completed.

Note that `result` is a `Result` that contains the original stream (compare to
`and_then`, which passes the stream without the `Result` wrapper). This allows us
to sequence additional reads or writes to the same stream. However, we have
nothing more to do, so we just drop the stream, which automatically closes it.

# Running the client task

So far we have a `Future` representing the work to be done by our program, but we
have not actually run it. We need a way to 'spawn' that work. We need an executor.

Executors are responsible for scheduling asynchronous tasks, driving them to
completion. There are a number of executor implementations to choose from, each have
different pros and cons. In this example, we will use the default executor of the
[Tokio runtime][rt].

```rust
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# extern crate tokio;
# extern crate futures;
#
# use tokio::prelude::*;
# use futures::future;
# fn main() {
# let client = future::ok(());
println!("About to create the stream and write to it...");
tokio::run(client);
println!("Stream has been created and written to.");
# }
```

`tokio::run` starts the runtime, blocking the current thread until all spawned tasks
have completed and all resources (like files and sockets) have been dropped.

So far, we only have a single task running on the executor, so the `client` task
is the only one blocking `run` from returning. Once `run` has returned we can be sure
that our Future has been run to completion.

You can find the full example [here][full-code].

# Running the code

[Netcat] is a tool for quickly creating TCP sockets from the command line. The following
command starts a listening TCP socket on the previously specified port.

```bash
$ nc -l 6142
```
> The command above is used with the GNU version of netcat that comes stock on many
> unix based operating systems. The following command can be used with the
> [NMap.org][NMap.org] version: `$ ncat -l -p 6142`

In a different terminal we'll run our project.

```bash
$ cargo run
```

If everything goes well, you should see `hello world` printed from Netcat.

# Next steps

We've only dipped our toes into Tokio and its asynchronous model. The next page in
the guide will start digging a bit deeper into Futures and the Tokio runtime model.
